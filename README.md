[Gooey](https://github.com/cookiengineer/gooey) (GUI) is divided in two parts:

- A pure Go WebASM [bindings](/bindings) framework that bridges the gaps between Go, WebASM and Browser APIs.
- A pure Go Web UI [components](/components) framework that structures a Web Application, ready to be used in local Web Views.


## Motivation

Problems in modern Web App Development:

- Components are great as a separation of feature concept.
- Components are bad for web accessibility (`aria-` property fatigue).
- Frontend-to-Backend communication is always a problem.
- Frontend Routers differ always from Backend Routers.
- Frontend schema safety and validation is always implemented redundantly.
- Backend schema safety and validation is great with `Marshal` / `Unmarshal`.

Conclusions:

- Let's use Go's types and schemas on both the Frontend and the Backend.
- Let's use dynamic Web Components for the Frontend via WebASM.
- Let's use static Web Components for the Backend via Go's native builds to provide server-side rendering.
- Let's deploy offline-first Apps via `webview/webview` and online Apps via webservers.


## Architecture

Gooey uses a Reactive MVC Architecture and embraces the use of a unidirectional
flow, meaning it is a circular pattern of state management.

This is a nice architecture pattern for deserialization and serialization of the
Schemas into Views, because all custom application code lands in the controllers,
which manage the Views, Storages and networking code.

## Documentation

- [ARCHITECTURE.md](/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) documents the architecture of a Gooey App.
- [BINDINGS.md](/docs/BINDINGS.md) documents the state of implemented web bindings.
- [COMPONENTS.md](/docs/COMPONENTS.md) documents the state of implemented web components.
- [TODO.md](/docs/TODO.md) documents the work-in-progress of things that will be implemented in the near future.


## Examples

The [examples](/examples) folder contains minimal test cases that show how you can
use the bindings. They also contain a separate `main.go` which is compiled into a
`main.wasm` file and a `serve.go` which reflects the local webserver.

All examples are served on `http://localhost:3000` when the `build.sh` is executed.

Important: These examples also serve as unit tests, because `go test` cannot generate
binaries for the `syscall/js` platform. As soon as unit tests are available, the plan
is to migrate towards go-integrated tests that are compatible with `go test`.
